Initialize an empty dictionary `results`

For each subfolder in the 'ipgroups' directory:
    List all files in the subfolder
    Create a temporary dictionary `file_pairs` to store filename bases as keys and file paths as values

    For each file in subfolder:
        Extract the file base name without extension
        If base name exists in `file_pairs`:
            Add the current file to the list under the base name
        Else:
            Initialize a new list under the base name in `file_pairs` with the current file

    For each base name, filename pair in `file_pairs`:
        If the list contains both a YAML file and a CSV file:
            Set `yaml_file` to the YAML file path
            Set `csv_file` to the CSV file path (the group name is the base name)

            Parse `yaml_file`:
                Load YAML content
                For each device entry in YAML:
                    Extract `adomname`
                    If (`adomname`, base name) not in `results`:
                        Initialize (`adomname`, base name) in `results` with details
                    Else:
                        Update existing entry with additional details or count

Output `results`
